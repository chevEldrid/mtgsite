Having just completed a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Chev is eager to develop his skills in both software development and Magic content creation. He’ll be bringing you content on Brawl, Commander, and some streaming in the upcoming weeks with a couple series soon to be announced. Chev is probably also responsible for anything broken on the site so he’s the person to contact for that.

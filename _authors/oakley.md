Oakley works as a Systems Integration and Validation Engineer at Starry, Inc. He loves to learn about and watch all different kinds of Magic formats and wishes he had the money to play half of them. In paper he owns a few commander decks, but he also plays Brawl, Standard and Limited on MTG Arena (and sometimes pauper on MTGO). Besides playing Magic and ~~breaking~~ fiddling with computers, Oakley enjoys snowboarding, longboarding, boxing and napping.

Having finished his bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering Eric now works in Project Management for Siemens Smart Infrastructure. He began playing Magic in highschool and continued throughout his college career. Commander and limited are his preffered formats. Eric began with a heavy love for Timmy style decks in Commander but also feels at home behind the wheel of a well tuned cEDH deck. He will be making content that runs the gamut from fun budget decks to well tuned competitive decks.

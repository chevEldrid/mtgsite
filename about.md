            <h2>A Lil’ History Lesson</h2>
            <p>Our playgroup was founded in 2015, narrowly avoiding a fate of Yu-Gi-Oh thanks to some quick thinking by the proprietor of a local game shop. Since then, Magic has become a way for us to stay together and continue to foster a friendship that has since endured through our college experiences and continues to develop as we enter into the professional world and our adult lives.</p> 
            <br />
            <h2>What’s Our Angle?</h2>
            <p>For us, Magic has always been a force inspiring unity. Spending each school break when we’re all together whipping out new and exciting builds for a night of Commander, drinking beer and swapping stories. Or driving across state lines to meet up for midnight prereleases. There are endless tales like this for us, as I’m sure there are for many of you.We want to share those experiences and memories with you and hear yours, all while toasting our favorite beverages.</p> 
            <br />
            <p>Countless outlets exist to get every type of Magic fix available.

            all provide great content. We enjoy serving up competitive analysis and meta discussion, but we also want to provide a window into how we experience magic and how it has been an outlet of creativity for us. We found that magic is not only a game, but a way to communicate. It could be explaining your incredibly convoluted and “totally tier 1” combo you assembled to your friends around the kitchen table, or just discussing all the hot spoilers that'll slot into your commander decks around the campfire.  These holistic experiences that most people would tell you are their favorite memories of the game should be shared with joy: and we want to bring that to all of you. Best Commanders to play during a night of drinking? How is crafting a deck like making Homebrew? Which of our decks have aged like fine wines and which went down the hatch quick like a shot of bottom tier vodka. Every game and every card has its own story. We’d love for you to join us in recanting this all. Grab a drink and shuffle up!</p>

            <p><b>Chev Eldrid</b> - Having just completed a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Chev is eager to develop his skills in both software development and Magic content creation. He’ll be bringing you content on Brawl, Commander, and some streaming in the upcoming weeks with a couple series soon to be announced. Chev is probably also responsible for anything broken on the site so he’s the person to contact for that.</p>
            <p><b>Julian Leal</b> - A recent graduate of the University of Maryland, Julian has spent the last year developing his professional career as a Geologist. Though he’s most at home playing Commander, Julian has also spent this time striving to branch into all other constructed formats and brewing around anything and everything. Expect brews and competitive decks in Standard, a delve into Historic, and the occasional foray into limited (plus whatever other debauchery he can sneak past Chev). Julian will also be streaming, hopefully regularly.</p>

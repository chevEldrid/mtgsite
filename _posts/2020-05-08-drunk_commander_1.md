Everyone has their pet decks. In Commander, where cards don’t rotate and power creep is directly proportional to your income, this is especially true. These are the decks you’ve been grooming for years to be just the right amount of absolute carnage without sending your pod over the edge in frustration. I’m talking countless hours spent scrolling through Edhrec or running your thousandth hand draw on Tappedout to check the consistency of getting

For everything I love about the Commander format, there are drawbacks for needing to pay attention for hours at a time and remember the incredible amount of combo potential in the legacy card pool. Should you counter that

Here at the Brew Crew, we completely understand. Not every game needs to be played to the top of your ability, sometimes you just want to be in the driver's seat of a wrecking ball and break things. Introducing our brand new series:

<h1 class="text-center">Drunk Commander</h1>
<br />
I’m sure we’ve all been wondering what decks hold up the best under inebriation - and the Brew Crew is going to make the necessary sacrifices to find out. Each of the builds featured in these articles will be heavily tested for playability in both sober and intoxicated conditions. We’ll figure out how they handle against higher tier decks, and if all commanders really do pair best with the drink that provides the best pun of their name. Stay tuned.

**What makes a good Drunk commander?**
What are the characteristics of a general that can withstand the effects of alcohol the greatest? One option is commanders that promote a very linear strategy. They do one thing, and one thing only. Generally that’s going to be something like smashing face. This might include the likes of...

<img src="/assets/images/drunkCommander/dc1/drunkCommander1-1.png" class="img-fluid">

Maelstrom is all kinds of threat, and relies on a deck just packed with Temur good stuff since Cascade gives you no real say in what’s coming. All you know is it’s going to be big, destructive, and need to be answered. Oh, and will have haste because of course.

Borborygmos is a little more nuanced. IHe wants to hit all of the things all of the time. Considering every time he deals combat damage to your opponents he’ll buff your entire squad...it makes sense to keep him in that state as much as possible. If we’ve learned anything from Finding Nemo, it’s just keep swinging. Sure you might include some strategy with +1/+1 counters or tokens but you really don’t need to. Why make things more complicated?

<p>
Xenagos has been a format powerhouse for years. Not only can he often dodge creature removal with the Theros god clause, Xenagos’s combat trigger will always hit some big creature you ramped into doing what green does best. And with haste!! Again it simply won’t matter that you ignored the last three creatures played and a Rhystic Study, you’re swinging for 20 off the back of a

</a> while leaning back and sipping a Salty Dog. The only tech you need to know is bigger numbers = better.
</p>

The other characteristic to look for in a strong drunk commander is commanders that have inherent restrictions on what things players can do or when players can do said things. The best cases are when these restrictions apply to opponents. Maybe they can’t cast spells during combat, removing the need to worry about combat tricks. Maybe they can’t destroy your creatures. Perfect! Swing with abandon! For this type of deck we turn to:

<img src="/assets/images/drunkCommander/dc1/drunkCommander1-2.png" class="img-fluid">

We see three types of restrictions with this selection. Basandra prevents anyone from casting spells during combat. Not only are you stopping your opponents from instant speed removing your creatures or buffing their own, but also...and potentially more importantly...you’re eliminating the need for *you* to worry about playing combat tricks! It’s this kind of secret tech we’re always looking for here on Drunk Commanders.

Marisi requires a higher level of play in that now we might want to keep a few instant speed tricks up our sleeve...but that can turn out to be okay! You WILL need to focus for at least your own turn. I know, I know, but you’ll have plenty of time to slump right after your end step. Marisi prevents opponents from interacting with your combat *and* will force their creatures to swing back. Couldn’t be more straightforward! You can swing out besides maybe one big creature to caution the swing-back and keep on groovin.

<p>
Nikya makes it so opponents can’t play noncreature spells, that’s amazing! Wait...hmm...oh. Oh WE can’t play noncreature spells. Well hang on that could be a good thing! We’re all about reducing necessary brain power so frankly this is a serious upside. Unless you got something out there granting flash the only turn you have to worry about is your own! Plus, that secondary ability easily makes up for the restriction and then some. Double mana from lands?? In Green?! Can you imagine how fast you could windmill slam a <a

    Impervious Greatwurm
</a>? It’s just absolutely nuts. Opponents will be so busy attempting to deal with you, you won’t even miss the instants and sorceries.
</p>

Hopefully you’re starting to get an idea of what we’re looking for here. Generally we want big beefy bodies that are threats themselves while also limiting interaction in some key way. Either it’s preventing opponents from stopping your drunken onslaught, or it’s narrowly focusing your game plan until even three Old Fashioneds can’t slow your roll. 

Which brings us to our first highlighted General among those most likely to pair well with a Pacific Rim.

**Nikya of the Old Fashioned**

Like the best Old Fashioneds, Nikya can be a little hard to swallow at first but I assure you it gets so much better. This build is actually what inspired the entire series and I highly recommend giving it a shot!

<p>
Gruul’s vibe is generally a drunken rampage, and Nikya is no exception. While a 5/5 for 5 is no great feat in these colors the sheer destruction double mana can wreck cannot be overstated. One only needs to look at format staples like

Most green commander decks will focus on a ramp package with spells like

</p>

<p>
While their rate might be a little slower than some of the noncreature counterparts, these guys still put you ahead on turn three so you can successfully drop Nikya turn four. Don’t even need to worry about any of that non-creature stuff. We’ll round out the mana package with a couple dorks, particularly

    Birds of Paradise
</a>. The former letting a forest tap for a potentially obscene 4 mana, and the other doing a bit of color fixing. Nikya’s power comes from the land count so we’re doing what we can to encourage ramp over dorks - but some are just too good to pass up.
</p>

After that will come the removal suite. There’s no easy way to say this...but if you adhere to the doctrine of drunk magic there is a chance your opponents will have more brain power at their disposal. Ideally, they’ve followed your impressive lead in imbibing themselves, in which case you take the advantage of a linear-strategy deck. But should they be, dare I say, sober...you need ways to rid the table of the threat they may possess. I’m talking about creatures with those sweet sweet ETBs!!

<img src="/assets/images/drunkCommander/dc1/drunkCommander1-4.png" class="img-fluid">

<p>
Much of the removal package is focused on versatility at a higher cmc which we can afford thanks to Nikya, or previous efforts of Nikya that allowed us to play more ramping dorks. With the ability to hit almost anything on the board you don’t even need to strategize what needs to be taken out first!! Windmill slam a creature and destroy whatever looks scariest. It’s a foolproof strategy that will work 100% of the time, 70% of the time. Enough of these and your opponents won’t have a leg to stand on. We will include certain amounts of targeted removal too, can’t be forgetting our old pal

</p>

When all that removal doesn’t work, we run a counterspell. What? I hear you ask, in a deck so focused around creatures where we’re going so hard we’re even ditching cultivate you’re going to include a counterspell that can’t even protect Nikya? The answer to that is yes and once you see it you’ll know why.

    Counterspell
</a>, in Gruul there is only one true response and that is an angry armor-clad gorilla screaming so loud the blue mages cower in fear.

Lastly, and most importantly, you need a solid creature suite of big, dumb, and scary. Things that enter scary, things that get scary, all things that no matter when you draw them - they’re worth playing. Honestly you could include every other gruul legendary listed as potential commanders above and be off to a fantastic start! Focus on anything with enough power that your opponents exhale when they see it. That is a very good signal. This is where the most amount of individual flavor can come into the deck too. Since we are hamstrung by Nikya’s downside the amount of creature-ramp and removal are much more necessary than in decks that can more easily run multiple copies of

That’s right, Gruul has always hated noncreature spells and now you can channel that hate in an incredibly powerful way! You almost never need to worry about the condition because of the incredibly high creature count we’re rocking and if Nikya’s out? Like a true friend they’ll be stopping you from making a fool of yourself. Even killing this thing right after it’s played will reward someone with 6 damage.

**Deck Strategy**
<p>
You swing. Swing and/or smash, preferably both. The plan is a simple one but with the number of high-power threats you’re running, it sure is effective. I’ve included a decklist at the bottom with the current iteration of Nikya that I run. It does have a few tricky pieces to worry about while slamming Singapore Slings, mostly

Before diving into what makes Fleshtaker so good, let’s take a minute to appreciate some of the most horrifying art on an MTG card in the past couple years, props to Kev Walker for making me legitimately afraid of cornfields this Halloween season. Anyway, Fleshtaker. A solid stat-ed body with a powerful sac ability, Fleshtaker is probably most comparable to <a

Dina, Soul Steeper
</a>. Where I think Fleshtaker goes above and beyond Dina is giving us access to white’s ability to generate a ton of creature tokens, the perfect ammunition to feed this child of the corn before going in for a killing blow. Fleshtaker also plays wonderfully with white lifegain synergies providing that little bump with every creature sacrificed, and as <a

### Bladestitched Skaab

Bladestitched Skaab
</a>. This commander is all upside. You can play an incredibly aggressive zombie tribal deck supported by plenty of excellent includes from Midnight Hunt (see <a

Diregraf Horde
</a>, etc), and still have all the great removal, card draw, and overall the most powerful cards from blue and black. Or you can play a deck that plays normal combos (especially if you’re rolling in the cPDH crowd) that also has a way to start going wide and attacking when your plans are foiled. A very versatile commander propped up by one of the best tribes in the game and arguably the best color combo in the format.

### Rootcoil Creeper

### Devoted Grafkeeper

Devoted Grafkeeper
</a> has a bunch of tasty includes from Midnight Hunt to prop it up. But, there’s also plenty of flashback cards, retrace cards, etc., that you can cast for from your graveyard to tap down blockers. Hello <a

Marshaling Cry
</a>, let’s beat face uncontested cause all our opponents creatures are tapped. And then, when your Grafkeeper dies, you can let him go to the graveyard, dodge some commander tax and turn him into a potent threat; 3/1 flyer is no joke, especially when you’re already doing evasive and aggressive things. Not the most powerful or broken pauper commander, but certainly one that rewards deck construction exploration.

### Flame Channeler

Flame Channeler
</a> embodies everything that red does well, all in one package. A 2/2 for two mana isn’t anything special but you can immediately get the combat train-a-rolling. Then, utilizing the numerous burn spells that red has (y’all remember that <a

Embodiment of Flame
</a>. Now, whenever you bolt anything, you can start cashing that in for cards off the top. Mono red struggles with card draw, but you can easily chain through your deck just by burning peoples’ faces or controlling the board, aka everything you want to do. This is an excellent and versatile mono-red commander in PDH, especially if you’re tired of blue having all the fun of spell-slinging and tearing through their library.

### Honorable Mention: Delver of Secrets

This might not be the most exciting, since Delver has been a known quantity in many formats for years now… but this time, it’s been printed at uncommon. That’s right! You can have <a

Delver of Secrets
</a> in your command zone. You probably know this, but just to clarify 100%, there are a LOT of good blue cards in PDH. A LOT of those are instants and sorceries. Having a flying 3/2 attacking on turn two is no joke and with the amount of draw, counters, etc, Delver can put opponents on a clock ASAP. If you’ve always been wanting to make a mono-blue deck, Delver is a great place to start.

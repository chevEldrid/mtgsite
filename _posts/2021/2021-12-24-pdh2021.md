Welcome! To cap off this truly insane year that has given PDH oh so much, we thought we’d go back and hit on some of our favorite new cards from the last 12 months. (We’re trying to avoid using the term “best” since there’s some subjectivity there but like, we’ve never been wrong before so….) Anyway, here are some of our favorite PDH Picks for 2021!

### Favorite Removal Spell

2) While Bone Shards might feel more immediately castable with an alternate cost of discard as opposed to sacrifice…I *really* like Eaten Alive’s mana-intensive alternative for the PDH late game. More than anything else in long PDH games I’m suffering from an empty grip, so the last thing I would ever want to do is lose two cards for the price of one. Unless we’re talking an <a

First off, *Foretell* has become basically my favorite mechanic of all time. Blue is already my favorite color and one of the best colors in PDH for its versatility, velocity, and sheer number of combo cards. And now you’re telling me I can flip the bird (literally) to all those color pie purists (hey Chev, suck it) and **Exile**, with a capital “E”, creatures AND ARTIFACTS?? ‘Tis truly the season of giving thanks.

### Favorite Sleeper Hit

<br />

**Chev**: While the term “Sleeper Hit” might be subjective, the sheer badassitude of Deepwood Denizen is not. Card Advantage in PDH can get tight in the late game, especially if you’re not in blue or black so having a repeatable source can be HUGE. We’ve seen the Campus lands from Strixhaven (<a

	Quandrix Campus

	Hamza, Guardian of Arashin

**Jules**: Honestly, I’m just in love with the amount of white cards that were printed this year with the magic phrase “Draw a card” on them. For me, <a

	Search Party Captain
</a> is the best of these. It encourages attacking, which is always a plus, and it’s so easy to play this for a single white mana. Maybe I’m dating myself with what gets me excited in a Magic card, but… If you want to talk about the unsung heroes, the simple blue-collar workers who make a format like PDH possible, it’s the Search Party Captains of the world. 

### Favorite Card Playable in PDH *and* EDH

**Chev**: While PDH might be the focus of this article, we’d be remiss to not share our favorite cards that cross the format boundaries, consistently providing value regardless what color your mana symbol is. For me, that’s Reckless Impulse. We highlighted this card when it came out in Crimson Vow, and since then it’s found a home in two of my red EDH decks (<a

	Act on Impulse
</a> introduced Red to “Impulse Draw” and boy howdy does it make most any deck run quite a bit smoother. Two cards for two is fantastic value and should be on the top of mind for any aggro-leaning build.

**Jules**: Turns out when you make a nearly strictly better analog to an already (dare I say) ubiquitous card in both PDH and EDH, it’s going to be good. <a

	Archaeomancer
</a>, gives redundancy to the quintessential recursion of spellslinger decks. Often these decks are Izzet, so congrats you get to play both, but for those who want to forego the stigma or bounty of blue, Ardent Elementalist gives much needed support in other color combinations. Whether you need to get back a crucial combo piece, a removal spell to stop an opponent’s impending win, or just to get a draw spell back to dig for gas, the elementalist is here for you. She’s easier to cast than Archaeomancer, and with the inverted stats might actually trade with something, only upside.

### Favorite New Commander

**Chev**: While 2021 has seen a massive influx of viable PDH commanders, none have spoken to me more than the potential of Koll, the Forgemaster. One of my earliest PDH memories was trying to convert my OG 2018 Brawl <a

	Reprobation
</a> and you’re taking one of the archetypes that made me fall in love with this format to brand new heights. In fact, Koll inspired the entire RW archetype in the PDH Cube that Julian and I spent the latter half of this year developing. It’s hard to say any other potential commander can top that honor.

	Gretchen Titchwillow
</a> was my second pick… yikes). Killian is actually disgusting just because of the sheer amount of mana he can save you starting as early as turn 3. All of your removal (and oh boy does black have removal, see literally any of our articles) is now 2 generic cheaper which means it's probably on par with 60 card format efficiency. But that’s just scraping the surface, because Orzhov control is so last year. We only need those discounted removal spells to move blockers out of the way so that our Killian who’s suited up with designer auras that he got on sale can come through and crash the party in the best way possible. Finally, the oft-maligned aura card type can shine in its true potential - aka when it’s not as overcosted as any item of fashion Kanye has ever put out.

**Chev**: This category was a biiit more open-ended, but coming from the guy who came up with it - the topic came after I decided I wanted to talk about these cards.

**Jules**: This pick is actually a jealousy pick because one of the coolest decks I’ve seen in action is a <a

	Ghost of Ramirez DePietro
</a> deck that Chev picked up from the [cPDH Database](https://budgetbrews.club/deck-lists/#pauper). One of the main things that makes the deck so potent is it has ways to exile or return cards from its graveyard to generate an army of zombies. Now, with <a

	Honored Heirloom
</a>, that deck has a perfectly reasonable mana rock that also doubles as a way to generate a zombie every turn cycle, at instant speed no less. When we saw the Heirloom spoiled, Chev and I both knew this would be a format staple, but especially in a Tormod style deck (also works well in Syr Konrad), and I was even more jealous because he was going to get to play this sick synergy and I would have to suffer at the hands of it.

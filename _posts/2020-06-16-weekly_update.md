## The Spoilers
Another impressive week for *Core Set 2021* as we see our final spoilers trickling in today along with the final dump of cards. Some notable highlights include a whole new set of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/wait-theres-core-2020-06-15" target="_blank">shrines</a>, [[Nine Lives]] (Which does some fantastic work with [[Solemnity]]), and [[Brash Taunter]]. Really, this set has it all and we're absolutely loving the cats and dogs subthemes!

We're also getting a slew of new legendaries with re-imaginings of old favorites and some totally fantastic new options. In fact we might have even written an article about one already...

## Homebrewed - Subira, Goblin Caravanner
We just couldn't help ourselves! [[Subira, Tulzidi Caravanner]] comes absolutely sprinting out of the gate with a fantastic set of abilities never seen before in red that opens up all kinds of fun commander ideas. Chev offers his opinions on pairing the aggressive legendary with a horde of bloodthirsty goblins. What fun!

## Homebrewed - Look What You Made Me Do
Sliding in just in time for publication last Friday, Chev says goodbye to his less-than-stellar [[Hanna, Ship's Navigator]] brawl deck in favor of a much more powerful Enchantment-matters build featuring none other than his old nemesis: [[Alela, Artful Provocateur]]. Hope there's no Bad Blood!

## Cube Draft - Julian
he does some stuff with a cube lmfao aren't cards rectangles?

## The Pod
A brand new episode of The Brew Pod should be out tomorrow as Chev and Julian continue to dive into *Core Set 2021* spoilers, the financial impact of Mystery Boosters, and maybe even other shit! Who fucking knows!

</a>. Really, this set has it all and we're absolutely loving the cats and dogs subthemes!

We're also getting a slew of new legendaries with re-imaginings of old favorites and some totally fantastic new options. In fact we might have written an article about one *already*...

	Subira, Tulzidi Caravanner
</a> comes absolutely sprinting out of the gate with a fantastic set of abilities never seen before in red that opens up all kinds of fun commander ideas. Chev offers his opinions on pairing the aggressive legendary with a horde of bloodthirsty goblins. What fun!

## Homebrewed - Look What You Made Me Do
Sliding in just in time for publication last Friday, Chev says goodbye to his less-than-stellar

## Arena Cube Draft - Julian
Arena Cube is up and running providing a powerful draft format with all-stars from Standard and Historic. Though he had a less than stellar first showing, Julian looks forward to delving into this format, because there are powerful cards and synergies galore! There will definitely be more Arena Cube in the future. (Why's it called a cube though lmao aren't cards rectangles?)

## On the Rocks - Jund Food
Now that, Standard is returning to a pre-Ikoria meta, Julian thinks it's the perfect time to take his favorite deck from the past year out for a spin. With some new tweaks and a history lesson for you young whippersnappers, hopefully he can keep his ovens full and his crumbs in a trail!

## NEW SERIES! Fireside Chat
Julian has all sorts of brews in the work for new *Core 2021* cards, but he isn't quite ready to share them. Instead he wants to start this new series of discussions with a look at Planeswalkers, their historical and current status, and play design of Planeswalkers going forward.

## The Pod
A brand new episode of The Brew Pod should be out tomorrow as Chev and Julian continue to dive into *Core Set 2021* spoilers, the financial impact of Mystery Boosters, and maybe even other stuff!

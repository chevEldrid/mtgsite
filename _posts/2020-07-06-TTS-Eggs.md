Hello and welcome to *The Top Shelf*. I’m Eric and I’ll be your guide for most of this series. I am being brought on to add a new voice and additional perspectives to *The Brew Crew*. You can read more about me and find other articles by me on my author page here (https://brewcrew.net/authors/eric.html)! *The Top Shelf* is a new series, focusing on unique commanders that have exciting potential in both competitive and casual magic. There are a lot of commanders that fall into this category but we’ll start with one that I have been interested in for a long time:

Her ability initially makes you wonder what ‘Eggs ‘are there in *Magic* and how good are they? Don’t let the eggs fool you though, for the competitive build we’re looking at today the real eggs aren’t eggs at all. Instead they are Changelings! Creature’s with the Changeling ability count as eggs, which is just fine for our purpose.

Atla was originally a secondary commander in C19. The base deck was designed to continuously create and copy tokens. Jumping off from that point would typically make you think of creatures that make tokens or a large battlecruiser deck that cheats some mana through sacrificing eggs. We'll even be going into one of those later in this article. But for now, we’re going to look at Atla as a combo focused commander. 
<br />

## I’m not Even Yolking, It Works

Atla has a bespoke combo that works with her triggered ability. It requires us to run the following cards:

	Mirror Entity
</a>, a card that does damage when it enters or leaves the battlefield, and a card which can shuffle our graveyard back in when it dies. Additionally, Atla needs to have either a temporary stat bonus for the turn or a +1/+1 counter. The good news is that we only need Atla,

	Mirror Entity
</a>, and the buff in play to actually start the combo. The rest can be in our deck, our graveyard, or even exiled from the game.

This will set the toughness of all your creatures to zero and makes them all eggs, but Atla will survive due to the buffs we just gave her. Mirror Entity will die and cause the next creature in your deck to flip onto the field. It too will be an egg with zero toughness, so it’ll die and rotate out as well. This repeats until we run out of creatures. We can loop this process by shuffling our graveyard back into the deck with a card like

## Protecting Our Nest Eggs

Most competitive EDH metas are rife with stax and other defensive tools to prevent combo wins like ours. So, included in this deck are a variety of creatures who will help remove those obstructions as we cycle through with the Atla combo.

These creatures will do a lot of work toward protecting us after we’ve entered the loop, but we'll need some protection beforehand as well. Naya doesn’t have a very wide selection of cards that fall into that category. However, we can still find some powerful cards among them, see

## Naya Can’t Combo… Unless?

Competitive decks can struggle if they only have one route to victory. So, in order to avoid those issues we're going to run a suite of other typical combos that fall into our colors. The first ones that come to mind for most are the variations involving

Offense isn’t going to be enough to get us across the line though. On the scale of cEDH decks, we don’t expect to keep up with Tier 0 decks, but we do need to be able to stop some decks faster than ours. In order to do this we’ll be running a light stax package to compete with those strategies. But not to worry, we won’t hurt our own game plan too much.

## Easter Egg Hunt

Now, for the final question: How are we going to find and play all these cards we just talked about? To play our main combo in one turn is a minimum of eight mana, including four colored mana (WWRG). In order to find all our pieces and have the mana to play them, ramp and tutors are going to be key. 

We run an interesting mix of ramp packages to make sure that our hate cards (and those of our opponents) don’t end up hitting us too hard. Mana dorks, such as

Well, that is all on our competitive deck. With this guide on the build you can feel free to make your own meta dependent switches. In the sideboard of the deck I call out a few helpful cards that can be subbed in depending on budget and meta. Even if your first few matches end up being a bit scrambled or hard boiled, I’m sure you’ll be winning matches over easy in no time! (I’m not even close to sorry about the egg puns).

## All Our Eggs In One Basket

Let’s take a step back now that we’ve finished one of our decks. We originally said this commander would be great for a less competitive build focused on eggs, tokens, and the sweet sweet taste of battlecruiser magic. Well, I’m excited to let you know that’s exactly what we’re talking about next. This build is going to run you under $200 and should fit in a more casual and/or combat focused meta.

And that’s it! All the Naya eggs. Wait, that’s it? *Frantically checking notes.* That can’t be it, right? How are we going to make this deck work with four eggs? Well, we're going to have to rely on Atla’s slightly underwhelming activated ability for the most part. But, we still have some good news coming!

	Nesting Dragon

(PSA, do not try to activate Mirror Entity’s ability for 0 in this deck. You will not enjoy the results.)
<br />
What if we clone our eggs?. Atla and Nesting Dragon both make egg tokens, so populating and doubling tokens can be very powerful for us... Of course a lot of token doublers would bust our budget pretty hard, but

## Loot Boxes, In My Card Game?

Well, now it’s time to hatch those eggs and find out just what is inside! In order to cycle through these eggs fast enough to see our powerful cards, we're going to need some sacrifice outlets or ways to crack these eggs. In Naya we don’t have a ton of options, but they definitely exist. For example,

We're going to be running a pretty tight selection of creatures so that every time we crack an egg we either get another egg or a powerful creature. Enter the battlefield triggers will really help exaggerate the effects we get from cheating mana.

## Green Eggs and Ramp

I think there’s some bad news coming though… We may not always get to turn a bunch of eggs into massive creatures at little to no cost. We may at some point need to start paying for these monsters, so mana ramp is going to be a prominent feature of our deck. Unfortunately we don’t get to use mana dorks because seeing one come out of an egg may actually break my heart.

Let’s start with the land ramp.

Lands aren’t the only way to ramp though, artifact ramp is in some ways even more powerful, but with its own weaknesses. The signets are a great way to start off at this power level, so let’s toss in the full set.

Well, that concludes my analysis on this version of the deck. I tried to keep this to a budget that made sense to me, but I remember hating spending money on lands when I could get some game winning eight-drops for the same price. I’ve offered some higher end suggestions in the maybe board of the deck list. Feel free to make any substitutions you’d like though! This is a deck that can be driven in pretty much any direction. Tribal and Token themes could be more pronounced if that appealed to you. If you have any commanders you’d like to see me do an analysis of like this or any thoughts on the series feel free to let us know on Twitter or in the comments below! Thanks so much for the read and see you next time on *The Top Shelf*!

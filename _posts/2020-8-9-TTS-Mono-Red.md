hook: Now we're cooking with gas! Let's burn the house down with this fiery commander.

Oof, what week is it? Why are my shoes gone? Is that a satyr chasing an animated brownie? I tell ya, they know how to party on Eldraine. Anyway, I was supposed to come here and interview one of the ‘Syrs’ for a TTS I think. I feel like I have some notes from when I arrived... Oh yeah! Here we go, <i>

The rest of the page appears to be completely blank… So, I guess I’ll go find her to see if she has anything to share about how to build her decks. Mono red would certainly be a challenge… Her ability to exile cards whenever a player is damaged definitely makes more offensive strategies pay off. Generally the combat step is where your damage is done, especially in less competitive pods. For the first build, I would probably go with something like a budget voltron deck. Using Syr Carah’s ability to exile cards as pseudo draw whenever you land an attack, then pairing red’s love of artifacts with powerful equipment could have something going. In a more competitive vein we don’t want to rely on being able to get attacks off. In reality it would be much better to never even need to tap her, given her lack of haste. That has me leaning toward a storm deck, where we can use burn spells to exile a lot of cards at once. A lot of rituals could keep things moving in terms of mana, then you just burn out your opponents with some of the artifact storm cards. Alright, I guess we should start by heading off to see the lady of the hour!

## The Armory
As always I think we’ll be starting with the budget version of the deck. This will run you under $250 and be a great jumping off point for any future voltron decks you want to build. I thought the easiest place to start would be with the damage machine herself,

</a>, so I got pointed to Carah’s room in the castle. I figured I would find her there, and be done with this article in a hot minute. Turns out, she left. But I did find some cool stuff here that seems to indicate I was on the right track. Her room appears to effectively be just an armory. There’s an

In the corner is a box labeled *“Do NOT Open”*, but I think she wouldn’t care… Well, I’ll be! Looks like our girl was hiding a few swords from us in her secret stash.

Well, her room turned out to be a bust. Let’s head out to the training grounds to take a look for her. I do see a lot of Embereth knights here, but not her.

Even if Syr Carah isn’t here let’s take a look at some other soldiers we can include in the deck. Voltron decks are quite weak to targeted removal, so let’s look for some other creatures who can take charge while she waits in the wings.

	Steel Hellkite

## A Personal Punch
This doesn’t quite feel like a Syr Carah deck yet though. Her ability to *draw* cards is very powerful in red, where actual draw is at a premium. Looking back on what I do remember from my week here, Syr Carah at one point just went off about

## Retracing Our Steps
Looking back through everything we’ve learned thus far, we aren’t any closer to actually finding Syr Carah, but we did pretty much reconstruct the first deck for her. The voltron shell is looking strong, so let’s run through your ideal opener then move on to our second deck. In this deck you are going to want to start with 3-5 mana sources in hand. At least two (probably three) of them should be lands. Given how much we are banking on Syr Carah for card advantage, it is going to be important to get her out ASAP. Once she is on the field we’re hoping to land some protection or powerful equipment on her right away. So keeping 1-2 pieces of equipment in your opener can be a great start. We would ideally like to round out our hand with one of our substitute beaters or a burn spell for once Syr Carah is on the field, but this last spot is pretty flexible and might change if you know you’re up against control or aggro mainly. Against aggro we would prefer some removal for their ramp or a way to turn their creatures against them. Against control we should be mulling reasonably hard for a way to ensure Carah can stay on the field for a bit once we play her (e.g.

This version of the deck is about as high powered as I could get it. On commander tier lists I have seen this commander listed in the same tier as

	Atla Palani, Nest Tender
</a>, our first *Top Shelf* subject. I feel like she may fall just slightly short, but don’t tell her I said anything. Not that anyone could find her right now to tell her. At this point we’ve searched her quarters, the training ground, and I’m running out of ideas. The last part of the castle left is the basement, so let’s take a look and see if I was right about building it as a storm deck for our more competitive option. Well, at a first glance I’m seeing an

Well, there are plenty of classic storm cards that we can include here, even without the use of blue or other traditional storm colors.

	Grapeshot
</a> is an actual storm card that has huge synergy with Syr Carah. Each of the individual copies will trigger her ability, exiling another card and allowing us to see more of our deck at once.

	Bonus Round
</a> is another card that should be saved for your all-in turns. However, it can be even more of a gamble as you’re often relying on lucky top decks or Carah exiles to keep you going after you start. This is the main weakness of the deck: sometimes you’re forced to go all-in because your opponents will win given another turn cycle.

	Desperate Ritual
</a> is freaking me out, I mean just look at his face. It’s a great card for our deck though, so I guess he can stay. Casting this from our hand to ramp out our commander or just ripping it off the top to keep our storm count climbing is going to be worth looking at his mug though.

	Neheb, the Eternal
</a> can be the biggest ritual of all if we are able to land him before passing through combat. The damage we deal in the first half of our turn can all get refunded for hopefully an even bigger second half of the turn.

These ritual effects will be great for keeping us going, but we can make that mana stretch a lot further if we reduce the cost of our spells. I’m sure I saw some cool looking artifacts sitting around down here.

	Cloud Key
</a> asks us to be a bit more picky about what we are reducing, but it shouldn’t be too hard of a choice. Given how key our commander is, creature is a totally viable choice, but once she’s down I would pretty much always pick instant or sorcery depending on what was in my hand.

	Helm of Awakening
</a> sits at the other end of the spectrum. We’ll reduce the cost on pretty much every card in our deck, but we’ll be doing the same for our opponents. We just have to hope we can capitalize off it better than they can, or that they’re dead by the time our turn is over.

	Increasing Vengeance
</a>, then copying Vengeance we get two copies of Vengeance and two burn spells. We then recopy vengeance and recopy the burn spell and repeat until everyone is dead. Every card in this combo is useful outside of it, which makes it very easy to run.

## Don’t Mind Us (Please)!
Alright, well Syr Carah wasn’t down in the basement either. I’ll finish this up with a mulligan guide then I really gotta figure out what happened last week.

We want to see Syr Carah levels of mana in our opener ideally, but at least 3 repeatable sources of mana could be good enough to hold. Do not, for example, keep an opening with

The perfect hand would also have an artifact tutor or one of our big artifact payoffs for the storm. Well, here’s the deck list.

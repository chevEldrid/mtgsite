Welcome back Chexdrinkers fans! There’s a lot of things going on with our crew recently, including another new author to our team! He’s hoping to join me in the mighty world of Brawl so hopefully you’ll be hearing from him soon...in the meantime welcome to a brand new series!

<div class="text-center">
    <h2>Plus40</h2>
</div>
<br />
For each **Plus40** we’ll be highlighting a Brawl Commander and a powerful deck strategy while also including what additional 40 cards will make that deck a *Commander* allstar come rotation. It’s a way to hold on to your favorite strategies and cards past the Brawl expiration date, or as a way to just level up your game into a *Commander* meta. And considering it’s a set list of 40 cards, you can transform back anytime! Our first swing at this versatile new series comes all the way from Dominaria in Core Set 2021...

Now, I know what you’re thinking and I was the exact same way. “Wait, a card that triggers off of card-draw … but it’s mono green. Chev. Buddy. This is a clear example of what should be in the 59 of someone with a more ‘blue’ persuasion.” And I can see the logic, BUT in this wild wild world we call standard Blue is not the only one drawing cards at ridiculous speeds. In fact, call me a heretic but between

Basically what I’m saying is, there’s a chance we can build an entire two decks around green’s ability to draw cards and not even miss the islands a little bit.

At her core Jolrael wants to be doing two things: making cats and buffing said cats with her mana sink ability. Drawing cards will have a positive effect on both since her buff is tied to cards in hand and will make our tokens. We’ll also include some extra go-wide synergy cards to sweeten the deal. That’s pretty much it! We want to be drawing cards, and we want to be loading up on as many

And what do we do once we’ve amassed so many cats we don’t know what to do with them? Well. We make them really big and we bap our opponent on the nose so violently they concede in a flurry of whiskers. Ideally, we’re using Jolrael’s ability to give everyone +x/+x on a hefty hand, but everyone needs backup.

At The Chexdrinkers Brawl Battalion we generally like to stay just competitive enough that we’re still able to come out positive, but not so competitive we’re ever restricted in our deckbuilding. That being said, it will always pay to have a suite of top-tier interaction and win-cons for when the going gets rough.

Nissa, Who Shakes the World
</a> is an excellent include from a mana perspective, a creatures perspective, and just a casual game-winning perspective. She doesn’t have much to do with cats but sometimes you just gotta beat someone with animated trees. Am I right, Ents?

## But wait! There’s more!

Thaaaaat’s right everyone it’s time for the _Commander_ build. Now, obviously there are cards that could be swapped out of our Brawl baby for a more intense final product but that’s not what this is about, son! We’re talking a straight Brawl DLC! This is like a season pass to all things Jolrael that can just be combined with your existing list for that little extra oomph!

We’ll be sticking with the same themes: drawing more than once per turn and going wide, but adding the more powerful older siblings to a lot of our Brawl picks. Add a classic package of protection and removal to round things out.

## Talk less, Draw More

Well, we won’t be causing any confusion about what we’re against or what we’re for, we’re FOR drawing a ridiculous number of cards. We’re AGAINST our opponents being able to do anything about it.

Finale of Devastation
</a>. I….I don’t think I ever fully grasped what this card actually did but now that massive price tag makes sense. Not only is it a tutor that can search your graveyard for a game-winning piece but if you’re playing this late enough creatures will get +10/+10 and haste.. There’s a non-zero chance I’m going to be running out and getting a copy as soon as I finish this article. Jeez.

## Treat Yo Self.

So far we’ve kind of stayed in the lanes designated by our Brawl build, but while Brawl is improved by the innovation required by a smaller card pool, Commander really shines due to the sheer volume of synergies available in lanes that haven’t been printed in a while.

Parallel Lives

Beastmaster Ascension
</a> has seen a lot of attention recently for just giving a permanent bump to all your creatures once you get it up there.

There’s still a few more goodies in there that fit into the above categories or provide some extra flexibility but I’ll let you find them out for yourself, or let me know if I missed anything in the comments! Thanks so much for tuning in!

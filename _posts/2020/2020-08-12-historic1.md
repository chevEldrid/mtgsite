What’s good y’all?! Today, Chexdrinkers treads into new territory… _Historic_! I’ve been hearing increasing murmurs of the format and its potential greatness. With my interest in _Standard_ waning for the time being, and the recent shakeups across many formats, I figured this was a perfect time for me to fully delve into the format in a new series: _Historically Speaking…_!

But as I was booting MTGA up, I realized, I have no clue what I’m doing.

So, for my benefit and your entertainment, this article will detail the beginning of my foray into _Historic_; how it works, the card pool, the in and outs, I’ll present my full research on all of this as a baseline for moving forward. I’ll also discuss the meta a bit, though that is in flux at the moment. This article will mostly act as a sort of primer and then I hope to get into gameplay and deck techs later on.

## The Island of Misfit Toys

*Historic* is a non-rotating format exclusive to *MTG Arena*. This means that unlike *Standard* cards will stay in the format forever unless they’re banned. The *Historic* pool includes any cards that have ever made their way to *Arena*. *Dominaria*, *Ixalan* as well as the more recent pick-and-choose remasters but we’ll get to those in a minute.

Since _Historic_ was designed as a digital format, it also allows _Wizards_ to tweak it and try new things on a much larger scale and more consistently. This is a uniqueness that you can’t get in paper formats or ones that have long standing histories. Now you may be thinking that just means bannings and unbannings will be much more frequent, but there are other ways to shake up the format that are more interesting and arguably healthier than constant banlist adjustment.

## Old Toys = New Toys

Historic, similar to the precedent set by _Modern Masters_ last year, has its own unique sets that inject cards directly into the format bypassing _Standard_ completely. These _Historic Anthologies_ are small, curated batches of cards from across _Magic’s_ vast history designed to fill gaps in the format. Adding answers to unchecked strategies, fan favorites from history, or support for new archetypes that need a boost, that’s what these products do for the format.. Powerhouses from days gone by like

Serra Ascendant
</a>. These anthologies cover a broad spectrum of interesting play styles and eras to make _Historic_ truly unique.

So far, three of these anthologies have been released. <a href="https://scryfall.com/sets/ha1?as=grid&order=set" target="_blank">_Historic Anthology I_</a> in November of 2019 brought 20 new cards, <a href="https://scryfall.com/sets/ha2?as=grid&order=set" target="_blank">_Historic Anthology II_</a> in March of 2020 had an increased 25 cards, and in May of 2020, <a href="https://scryfall.com/sets/ha3?as=grid&order=set" target="_blank">_Historic Anthology 3_</a> upped the package again to 27 new cards to play with. Each one (which granted a playset of each card included) was available for 3400 gems on _Arena_, or individual cards could be crafted using the wildcard system. Though these are no longer available as bundles like before, _Wizards_ has said they hope to drop new cards into _Historic_ every quarter, so we can almost certainly expect anthologies 4, 5, etc. to drop moving into next year with a similar amount of cards (or slightly increased) and with a similar “price point”.

Though that isn’t the only way new cards get added into _Historic_. In December of 2019,

Rhys, the Redeemed
</a> was added into both _Brawl_ and _Historic_ as part of the _Brawlidays_ special event. Though nothing like this has happened since, it’s safe to say that we could receive singular (or much smaller than an anthology) drops as part of special events at really any time.

The most recent and largest addition to the format comes in the form of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/introducing-jumpstart-new-way-play-magic-2020-02-20" target="_blank">_Jumpstart_</a>, the supplemental summer set released a few weeks back. _Jumpstart_ included a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/jumpstart" target="_blank">host of tasty reprints as well as a slew of new cards</a> to assist each theme (and cater to eternal formats). Because of this and with its release on _Arena_, _Jumpstart_ cards also were added into _Historic_ (with a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/jumpstart-cards-being-replaced-mtg-arena-2020-06-17" target="_blank">caveat</a>). Exciting!

## Time-Out

So we have dedicated, curated drops, special event inclusions, as well as supplemental sets that can get added. All of these avenues mean the _Historic_ card pool is continually growing and cards that are new and exciting as well as helpful to the meta are constantly being shuffled in. But sometimes action needs to be taken to help balance the format.

I’m of course talking about the traditional way of “fixing” formats… **Bannings**. Something that we’ve been all too familiar with over the past year. <a href="https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Historic_(format)" target="_blank">_Historic_ has a banned list</a> just like other formats (in fact, it looks quite similar to _Standard’s_, more on that later), but it also has a second form of disciplinary action: the Suspension.

Another benefit of an all digital format is that instead of having to go through the ordeal of outright banning something, _Wizards_ can suspend cards, essentially putting them in “time-out”. A suspended card is not legal in the format, but it only remains in that status for a short time (usually one to two months). During this time, the meta can readjust and _Wizards_ can watch to see if the format becomes healthier or if other problems arise. After the allotted time, the card either moves from suspension to banning, or can be reintroduced into the card pool. Most cards so far have gotten banned after serving their time, but some cards have been returned to the format and it sets a nice precedent for the future.

Being able to more quickly take action, test the effects of certain changes, and also not having the feel-bads or negative PR of a true ban, the suspension system is interesting and probably good for _Historic_ and one of the benefits of an all digital format.

## As Above, So Below

Lastly, let’s discuss the _Historic_ meta briefly, so we know what we’re getting ourselves into. Given the power of the last year and a half of printings and also the so far limited card pool of the format, a lot of it looks similar to recent _Standard_. Up until the suspensions, Temur Reclamation was the top deck with variation on Bant and Sultai Ramp also doing well and variations of Sacrifice and Mono-red jockeying for position. In previous iterations of the format,

After digesting several metagame breakdowns and deck techs, I feel I have a reasonable understanding of the _Historic_ metagame. One of the characteristics setting it apart from _Standard_ is the presence of several powerful aggressive decks (though the recent bannings have started to prompt a resurgence in _Standard_). Mono-red, similar to its _Standard_ counterpart, is strong and recently a top-tier version of a Goblins deck has emerged thanks to the additions in _Jumpstart_ and

</a>, I suspect that these tier two decks will quickly rise to fill the space. Also, _Jumpstart_ cards are still fresh and haven’t been tested fully, so I hope they will start to make even more impacts and soon we’ll have a new set in _Zendikar Rising_ to shake things up even more!

I’m excited to explore this fresh new format! Next week I’ll be doing a deeper dive into the current decks and testing some of them out. After that it’s off to the Chexdrinkers special laboratory to concoct up some lists of our own! Hit us up in the comments or on social media for anything you want to see me build around, and remember to stay brewin’ y’all!!

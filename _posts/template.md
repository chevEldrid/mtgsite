Welcome to our template post! This first paragraph will appear on the home page along with the cover image above.

The rest of this text will only appear on the actual page.

use this guide for formatting: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

embedded pictures follow syntax:
<img src="/assets/images/RYE/rye1/rye1-1.png" class="img-fluid">
Oh, and while we're at it you can include any sort of html you want. markdown does its thing around it so 
<p>this is totally legal</p>

all pictures you want to be popover links, write with double brackets like [[this]]
(our article pre-processor will convert that to anchor tags.)

Breakdown of the identifiers at the top of the page:
    author - who wrote the thing
    cover - link to the image you want as the cover art for the article. Generally this will be an internal link
    length - number of minutes required to read the article (based on word count, lots of sites are doing it)
    youtube - IF this article is a companion piece to a stream, add link to vid here. Don't include otherwise
    categories - what (if any) article series the post belongs to. Samples listed above
    tags - the format and general beverage type associated with the article. Later, these will allow site viewers to view all articles that have to do with whisky, or standard, etc.
    title - the short title of the article you want in the tab, and what shows on homepage
    hook - text that appears on homepage to introduce the article

Welcome back to another exciting week in the World of Magic! 

## The Spoilers

Spoiler Season for Core 2021 started early last week with some absolutely spectacular looking cards and stellar reprints, having some comparing this to "Ultimate Masters lite" ...Not sure I'd go that far, but we are looking down the barrel of a set that includes [[Cultivate]], [[Solemn Simulacrum]], and [[Massacre Worm]]. Not to mention this bad boy!

Seeing its first reprint *ever*, Grim tutor has been a popular spec target and will absolutely find its way into my [[Selenia, Dark Angel]] Commander deck sometime soon...

We've also got a fantastic new Planeswalker from Amonkhet who will attempt to fill Gideon's boots for a bit and so far, I think there's a lot of potential here:

Basri already has a pretty fleshed-out <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/creating-basri-ket-2020-06-08" target="_blank">history</a> that's defintely worth a read. Here at the Crew, we're very excited to have Wizards featuring characters that aren't the Big Five. We've even got new Teferis and a Garruk in this set!

Scryfall of course is doing its damndest to keep us all in the know, so you can follow along with spoiler releases <a href="https://scryfall.com/sets/m21?order=spoiled&as=grid" target="_blank">here</a>

## The Livestream

Recently The Brew Crew hosted their first Twitch livestream! You can see the results of that for a limited time <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/642171059" target="_blank">here</a>. We had some fun, some laughs, some "interesting" plays but all in all we're excited to do it again soon! 

## Omnicience Draft

Wizards brought a fan favorite back to Arena this week with Core 20 Omniscience drafts, celebrating one last hurrah before Core 21 ascends the throne. Pulling a 7-2 record this might be one of the most successful drafts Chev's ever done so bravo! If you haven't given this format a try, I strongly recommend it. There is no better feeling than casting an [[Anticipate]] into a [[Winged Words]] and a [[Cavalier of Thorns]]. It's a fun time full of rediculous opportunities that will really give your brain a workout for draft pics. You can check the video out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RS9jwB1NtI" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Homebrewed - Impervious Greatwurm

Julian takes a deep dive into this misunderstood, gentle giant's potential. Check out several different avenues to exploit [[Impervious Greatwurm]]'s crazy stats and get around its hefty mana cost. 

## Rev Your Engines - Outlaw's Merriment

Julian is back to smash some face with another sick enchantment in Standard. Expect a lot of tokens, a lot of attacking, and a lot of general shenanigans as he builds around [[Outlaw's Merriment]]. Check back Friday and remember there's no honor among thieves!

## On the Rocks - MYYYYYSSSTTTTERRRRYYYYYY

Julian is planning on doing another *On the Rocks* this week... he just hasn't decided what he's gonna play yet. Either way, stay tuned for some gameplay, some commentary, and some Brew Crew comraderie!

## Podcast

Back by popular demand we've got episode 2 of The Brew Pod coming out in the coming days! Chev and Julian will discuss the upcoming set, how they've been keeping busy this week, and whatever else comes to mind! Tune in for more!

I think that's all from us so far but we're excited to give you some brand new RYE, Brawl, and whatever else we think you'll all enjoy this week. Until next time!

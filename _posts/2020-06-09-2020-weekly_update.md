Welcome back to another exciting week in the World of Magic! 

## The Spoilers

Spoiler Season for Core 2021 started early last week with some absolutely spectacular looking cards and stellar reprints, having some comparing this to "Ultimate Masters lite" ...Not sure I'd go that far, but we are looking down the barrel of a set that includes [[Cultivate]], [[Solemn Simulacrum]], and [[Massacre Worm]]. Not to mention this bad boy!

Seeing its first reprint *ever*, Grim tutor has been a popular spec target and will absolutely find its way into my [[Selenia, Dark Angel]] deck sometime soon...

We've also got a fantastic new Planeswalker from Amonkhet who will attempt to fill Gids boots for a bit and so far, I think there's a lot of potential here:

Basri already has a pretty fleshed-out <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/creating-basri-ket-2020-06-08" target="_blank">history</a> that's defintely worth a read. Personally I'm very excited to have Wizards featuring characters that aren't the Big Five. At least we also got a brand new Garruk in there too.

Scryfall of course is doing its damndest to keep us all in the know, so you can follow along with spoiler releases <a href="https://scryfall.com/sets/m21?order=spoiled&as=grid" target="_blank">here</a>

## The Livestream

Recently The Brew Crew hosted their first Twitch livestream! You can see the results of that for a limited time <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/642171059" target="_blank">here</a>. We had some fun, some laughs, some "interesting" plays but all in all we're excited to do it again soon! 

## Omnicience

Wizards brought a fan favorite back to Arena this week with Core 20 Omniscience drafts, celebrating one last hurrah before Core 21 ascends the throne. Pulling a 7-2 record this might be one of the most successful drafts I've personally ever done and would love to share with everyone! If you haven't given this format a try, I strongly recommend it. There is no better feeling than casting an [[Anticipate]] into a [[Winged Words]] and a [[Cavalier of Thorns]]. It's a fun format full of rediculous opportunities and will really give your brain a workout for draft pics. You can check that out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RS9jwB1NtI" target="_blank">here</a>

I think that's all from us so far but we're excited to give you some brand new RYE, Brawl, and whatever else we think you'll all enjoy this week. Until next time!

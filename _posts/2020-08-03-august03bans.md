</a> is banned.

Wilderness Reclamation has been essentially the defacto best deck in *Standard* since the last B&R. Reaching above half of the field in tournaments and having been a dominant archetype since it was printed, its time has finally run out. 

Growth Spiral lies in a similar vein as ramp decks that run this (normally as a four-of) make uo nearly 70% of the metagame in recent tournaments. Ramp has become synonymous with *Standard* as of late and Growth Spiral is one of the biggest enablers. Axed.

With Temur Reclamation as a deck now removed from the format, the other two dominant forces naturally will rise up. Rakdos (and to a lesser extent, Jund) sacrifice decks, which in all variations run some combination of cat/oven are quite resilient and lethal. Removing their go-to interaction is a good way to keep them from becoming dominant.

Lastly, Teferi, Time Raveler has been a cause of restriction and frustration since its printing. It's play patterns are repetitive and completely deny a lot of other strategies or cards from being played. It was the main force holding back Temur Rec from total domination, but with that now gone, there's no reason for Teferi to stay in the format.

Overall, I wish action had been taken sooner, but these are all good choices that strike at the heart of the issue as opposed to tip-toeing around it. I am sad that Cauldron Familiar is gone as I adore Jund Food (and Chev likes Rakdos Sac, that sadist), but they would have been too dominant with the other pillars removed and cat/oven is an annoying (and on *Arena*, time consuming) synergy.

**Historic:**

*Historic* has recently been mirroring *Standard*. For similar reasons as above, Teferi and Reclamation are getting put in time-out like

	Fires of Invention
</a>, etc. before them. Like above, I like this action, especially with no rotation in *Historic* to remove these cards from the format in another two months. I'm still confused with the purpose and effectiveness of the suspension list, but I would not be surprised if Teferi and Reclamation make their way to being fully banned soon enough.

**Brawl:**

	Teferi, Time Raveler
</a> is banned.

Once again, Teferi is just not fun to play against and locks playstyles or cards out of viability. Having constant access to him in a format like *Brawl* makes this threat omnipresent, and with him making up 10% of the field and having some of the highest win-rates, I have no qualms with him being removed from the format.

**Pioneer:**

*Pioneer* has steadily moved toward *Modern* levels of degeneracy and this B&R cuts the legs out from the main pillars of the format. Inverter (comboing with

	Splinter Twin
</a> of *Modern*'s past, a versatile control deck with an, "Oops, I win," combo. It is the most popular deck in the format for this and its skill-rewarding play, but this has lead to its synonymy being scorned. Inverter of Truth as a key piece and also lacking redundancy (Thassa's Oracle can be replaced with

	Jace, Wielder of Mysteries
</a>) will remove the combo from the format, while preserving the shell it resides in.

Underworld Breach is another incredibly powerful and popular deck in the format, foregoing versatility for blistering combo degeneracy. Once again, this deck promotes no interaction and is dagnerously fast. Cutting out it's enabler, and generally broken namesake, will cripple the combo and make *Pioneer* ultimately a more healthy format.

Kethis combo (oh look, another combo deck) is a small portion of the metagame, but it boasts ridiculous win-rates. Similar to

	Krark-Clan Ironworks
</a> in *Modern*, this deck is convoluted and extremely hard to pilot, but rewards skill and diligence with wins upon wins. Once again, no complaints from me by removing this swift and deadly combo from the format.

Lastly, Walking Ballista fell upon Heliod's sword. 
<a
	class="accented-link"
	target="_blank"
	href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/18/heliod-sun-crowned?utm_source=api"

	Heliod, Sun-Crowned
</a> plus Walking Ballista makes for an early and game-ending two-card combo (I'm sensing a theme here). These decks weren't necessarily dominant, but they would be the most efficient once the pillars listed above were removed. Ballista can be run in any deck and its potential to be broken is much more varied than Heliod's, so I can see why it took the fall.

Overall, this is a huge mix-up for *Pioneer*, essentially crippling all the best decks. Once again, similar to *Standard*, I applaud hitting the issues at the root, there's no reason for other cool cards to die for broken cards' sin's. Slowing down the format and removing the least interactive combos should bring back the players that have been hemmorhaging from the queues. 

I look forward to seeing how all the new metagames shake out and you can bet that we'll be covering the brave new worlds emerging! Hit us up on social media and let us know what you think of these bans and what you're excited to brew now! This is Julian, over and out.
